# PetSmart
PetSmart is an all-in-one application for all animal lovers. Our app is designed to cater to stray animals and animals currently housed at local animal shelters which are up for adoption.
The app offers users the ability to look at stray animals and pets up for adoption in their locality and can then choose to either adopt them, or offer a donation for the care and upbringing of these animals. PetSmart also offers the ability for users to donate to various local animal organisations, and in doing so users earn Rupaws(an in-app currency) which they can then use to redeem exciting offers from partnered pet-stores and shops.

PetSmart also offers users the ability to add stray animals in their locality to the app which can be seen by the various animal shelters and can be then transferred to them.
## Rupaws
Rupaws is a centralised in-app currency which are earned bu users after making donations. These Rupaws can then be traded in for exclusive discounts from partnered stores which can benifit pet owners. This also creates an incentive for users to donate and further help out the institutions hosted on the app.
